# Local testing
If you want to test **Expo Open OTA** locally, you can use the provided docker-compose file to run the server locally
and expose it on internet using reverse proxy like ngrok.

## Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelmarciano/expo-open-ota
cd expo-open-ota
```

## Setup .env

Setup [environment variables](/docs/environment) by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

## Setup the dashboard (local)

To test the dashboard locally, you must first build it manually:

```bash
cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run build
````

## Run the server using docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The server is now running on port **3000**.

## üöÄ Running the Example App

The example app is located in apps/example-app and is designed to help you test the update server locally.

:::note
‚ÑπÔ∏è The app must be run in release mode to properly test OTA behavior.
:::

### Setup certificates

The signing certificates required for update validation are located in:

```bash
apps/example-app/certs/certificate-dev.pem
apps/example-app/certs/public-key.pem
```

To enable update signature verification, you must configure these certificates in your server environment.
[Ref](/docs/key-store#expo-signing-certificate)

### Build the Example App

```bash
yarn prebuild_production
OR
yarn prebuild_staging
```


### Configure the Expo Project

Create an Expo project in your Expo dashboard with two branches:
- `staging`
- `production`

Each branch should have its own release channel. Then retrieve the Project ID from the Expo dashboard.

### Update app.json

In apps/example-app/app.json, replace ``YOUR_PROJECT_ID`` with your actual Expo project ID:

``` json
"extra": {
  "router": {
    "origin": false
  },
  "eas": {
    "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  }
}
```

### Android Setup

```bash
yarn prebuild_production   # Prebuild the app with the 'production' config
cd android
./gradlew clean            # Clean previous builds
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Build the release APK
./gradlew installRelease   # Install the release APK on a connected device/emulator
```

### IOS

```bash
cd ios
pod cache clean --all
pod install
```
Then:
1. Open the iOS project in Xcode: open ios/*.xcworkspace
2. Go to: Product ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme
3. Under Run, set Build Configuration to Release

### Testing OTA Updates

Once the app is installed in release mode, use the following commands to test OTA updates:

```bash
yarn release_production   # Publish an update to the 'production' channel
yarn release_staging      # Publish an update to the 'staging' channel
```

The app will dynamically switch between channels at runtime if configured accordingly.
